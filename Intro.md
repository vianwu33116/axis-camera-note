Two key aspects make AXIS stand out. First, AXIS develops its own proprietary chips, demonstrating a commitment to maintaining quality and performance. Second, the integration of AI technology into their products is remarkable. With AI capabilities, AXIS cameras can detect and identify vehicles and people, as well as calculate the number of detected objects. This advanced feature, known as AXIS Object Analytics (AOA), enhances the functionality of their devices.

One of the most compelling aspects of AXIS's ecosystem is the AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP), which offers external developers the flexibility to integrate custom AI applications using C/C++ or Python on AXIS chips. This hybrid solution empowers clients and collaborators to explore broader AI possibilities and expand their use cases. Moreover, AI applications created by external partners can be commercialized and offered to other AXIS customers, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of innovation, creativity, and collaboration.
