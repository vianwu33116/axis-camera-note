# AXIS Camera Note

The purpose of this project is to document the notes and knowledge gained from using and integrating AXIS cameras.
I hope the note will be helpful to anyone working with AXIS cameras or tackling similar integration tasks.

Before starting, if you are not familiar with AXIS, [AXIS introduction](Intro.md) is recommended to read first.

The structure of this repository would be three main parts: [VAPIX API](/VAPIX%20API/), [Application](/Application/), [Media Stream](/Media%20Stream/).

## VAPIX API
